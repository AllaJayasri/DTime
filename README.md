#**DTime**

In this busy world we don’t have the time to wait in infamously long hospital queues. The problem is, queuing at hospital is often managed manually by administrative staff,  then take a token there and then wait for our turn then ask for the doctor and the most frustrating thing - we went there by traveling a long distance and then we come to know the doctor is on leave or the doctor can’t take appointments.

This application helps in registration of patients, storing their details into the system, and also booking their appointments with doctors. it includes managing doctors information, patient’s information as well. you can ask any questions related to doctors availability and waiting period using chatbot service.
